# DrQuine

42 2020 - Algorithmic project DrQuine

### About the project

This small algorithm project allows us to tackle the problems of self-replication, and confronts us with the recursion theorem of Kleene!
This is the first project of the Virus branch at School 42 Paris

The three folders ASM, C and Python contains the same three programs. Here's what they do:

Collen: During its execution, the program display on the standard output an output identical to the source code of the file used to compile the same program.

Grace: When running, the program writes to a file named Grace Kid the source code of the file used to compile the same program.

Sully: When running the program writes to a file named Sully_X. The X will be a given integer in the source. Once the file is created, the program compiles this file and then runs the new program
